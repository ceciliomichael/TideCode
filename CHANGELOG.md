## 1.0.1 — Dynamic tool discovery and execution

This patch release makes tool selection more reliable in natural-language requests and improves the handoff from model-generated arguments to tool execution.

- Improved dynamic tool search with stronger semantic matching, synonyms, and context-only query filtering.
- Added inferred search hints for custom tools based on their names, descriptions, and tags.
- Added a safe compatibility mapping for write calls that use `file` instead of the canonical `path` argument.
- Expanded dynamic-tool guidance and coverage for file search, editing, terminal work, task management, skills, and web research.
- Refined disabled-control colors across light and dark themes.
